# FaceTracker
uses OpenCV to recognize a face (from webcam video feed) and focus the frame on the face

### Prerequisites

OpenCV

Numpy

### Running FaceTracker

Created with a 480 x 640 input (you will need to update this if your camera feed is a higher resolution for better results)

Requires a webcam. Alternatively, you can update video_input = cv2.VideoCapture("filepath\filename") to run Facetracker with a video recording.
